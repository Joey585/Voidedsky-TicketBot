# Voidedsky TicketBot
 A ticket bot created for the sole purpose of the minecraft server, voidedsky. (A little hard-coded)
 
 
 I have been getting a lot better with just everything, so this isn't gonna be hardcoded anymore and everyting will be dynamic.
 
 Lot's of stuff has been acomplished already and I have few things to do before I release this bad boy to Voided Sky
